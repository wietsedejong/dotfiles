## How to use configuration variations

Open the wdots dotfiles settings app via the wdots Welcome App, the application launcher or the wheel icon in Waybar.

You can find several variation within the three settings pages.

- Monitor (Screen Resolutions)
- Animations
- Keybindings
- Windows 
- Window Rules
- Decorations
- Environments

Select the variation that you want to use from the corresponding drop down menu.

Please don't edit the shipped configuration variations. These will be overwritten with every update of the wdots dotfiles. <b>Create your own custom variation instead.</b>

## Create your own variation

Open the wdots dotfiles settings app via the wdots Welcome App, the application launcher or the wheel icon in Waybar.
